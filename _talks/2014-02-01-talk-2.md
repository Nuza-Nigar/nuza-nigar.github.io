Presented my paper on Store Separation. View [Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/116bSr37U0-0h7nM8nJHfytS_oC8Apqdk/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=115249795474572938960&rtpof=true&sd=true)
Testing store separation is risky, costly, and traditionally time-consuming with methods like flight tests and Wind Tunnel Testing. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) advancements have simplified this process by coupling Six Degrees of Freedom (Six DOF) and Navier Stokes (N-S) equations. Using CFD on pylon, wing, and store geometry allows the calculation of force and moments. This project validates store separation trajectory using Software Cradle with the Eglin Test Model, focusing on the ejector force profile. Employing Software Cradle's scFLOW code for a transonic Mach number of 0.95, it solves Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) Equation coupled with the 6 Degree of Freedom Equation using the overset meshing technique, resulting in good agreement with store displacement.
