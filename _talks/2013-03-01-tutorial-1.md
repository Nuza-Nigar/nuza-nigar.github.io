BENCHMARKING OF CRADLE CFD SOFTWARE TO  PREDICT STORE SEPARATION TRAJECTORY USING EGLIN TEST MODEL  AND  THE PREDICTION OF ONSET OF FLUTTER AND THE TRANSONIC DIP USING BSCW WING
Benchmarking Cradle CFD Software for store separation trajectory prediction using the Eglin Test Model showcases its accuracy in simulating complex aero-dynamics. Additionally, its predictive capabilities in determining the onset of flutter and the Transonic Dip with the BSCW Wing highlight its robustness in capturing critical aerodynamic phenomena, aiding in aerospace design validation.View [Thesis Presentation](files/thesis/Nuza_Nigar_500079890_2022_Presentation.pdf)
