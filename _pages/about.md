<span style="color:black; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Hello there and a warm welcome to my corner of the web!</span>

<span style="color:black; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">I'm Nuza Nigar, hailing from the vibrant city of Paris, France. As a Computational Fluid Dynamics Analyst, I've delved deep into the world of fluid dynamics and thermal mechanics. My academic path has been paved with achievements, securing top ranks in both my Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees, setting the stage for an exciting journey ahead. Currently, I play a pivotal role at Hexagon Manufacturing Intelligence, where I specialize in conducting intricate numerical investigations. Picture this: optimizing aerodynamics, diving into fluid-structure interaction simulations, and contributing to the groundbreaking work in the field. But that's not all! I've had the honor of being part of impactful research internships, collaborating on projects that fine-tuned aerodynamics for NASA. And those findings? They've journeyed far and wide, showcased at international conferences where I've shared insights spanning the fascinating realms of aerodynamics and thermo-fluid structure interactions.</span>
